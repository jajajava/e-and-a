/*
    IMPORTANT JAVA NOTES:

    Java consists of the compiler, called "Javac", and the interpreter, called the "Java Virtual Machine", or JVM. 
    When you run the command javac, the compiler checks for syntax errors. If the code is clean, it creates (or updates) a file called FileName.class
    Running java FileName is actually the JVM reading the compiled .class file (known as compiled bytecode), not the .java file (known as source code).
