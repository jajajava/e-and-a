BACKEND:
1. Add tipping option into Order (this is probably a frontend thing though, could be added as a tip in orderArray)
2. If there's a way to rearrange tables in database, put the created_at and updated_at in the back for every table
3. Figure out how to make tab's total add up in backend (with each order, not only at the end, unless you do a tab order_items lookup)

FRONTEND:
1. 
2. Make a tabs page to show active and old tabs
3. Fix CSS styling of components
