BACKEND:
1. Add tipping option into Order (this is probably a frontend thing though, could be added as a tip in orderArray)
2. If there's a way to rearrange tables in database, put the created_at and updated_at in the back for every table

FRONTEND:
1. Fix convertMenuItem function in OrderPage.js to accept other quantities and make tabs a thing (need to add setTabID usability that prefereably checks existing tabs first)
2. Create tab functionality + visibility
3. Fix CSS styling of components
