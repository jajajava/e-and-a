Experiments and assignments

Welcome to my e-and-a repository! As mentioned in my account description, I graduated from Georgia Southern University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
In this repository, you'll find code I wrote for school, my notes from classes, and personal experiments (some completed, some not).

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at davidstepanov2001@gmail.com and I will respond as soon as I am able!
