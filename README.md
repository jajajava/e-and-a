Experiments and assignments

Welcome to my e-and-a repository! As mentioned in my account description, I'm currently a college student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
In this repository, you'll find code I wrote for school, my notes from classes, and personal experiments (some completed, some not).

If you have any questions or inquiries, please reach out to me at davidstepanov@yahoo.com, and I will respond promptly!
