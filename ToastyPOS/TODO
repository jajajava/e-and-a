BACKEND:
1. Add tipping option into Order (this is probably a frontend thing though, could be added as a tip in orderArray)
5. Make a way to remove an order from a tab

FRONTEND:
2. Make a tabs page to show active and old tabs (Might be better to make tabs AND finished orders on the same page, not separate pages)
3. Fix CSS styling of components
4. Maybe show the time current tabs were opened and the time closed tabs were last updated??
5. Make tabs that were closed disappear after 24 hours?
6. Work on kitchen display next to show current orders
7. Make a card for each order like in irl POS, then load data in each one
