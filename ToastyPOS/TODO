BACKEND:
1. Add tipping option into Order (this is probably a frontend thing though, could be added as a tip in orderArray)
2. If there's a way to rearrange tables in database, put the created_at and updated_at in the back for every table
3. Figure out how to make tab's total add up in backend (with each order, not only at the end, unless you do a tab order_items lookup)
4. Fix tab so that once the tab is marked completed, THEN you can add a tip and get taxed *1.04

FRONTEND:
2. Make a tabs page to show active and old tabs (Might be better to make tabs AND finished orders on the same page, not separate pages)
3. Fix CSS styling of components
4. Maybe show the time current tabs were opened and the time closed tabs were last updated??
5. Make tabs that were closed disappear after 24 hours?
6. Work on kitchen display next to show current orders
7. Make a card for each order like in irl POS, then load data in each one
