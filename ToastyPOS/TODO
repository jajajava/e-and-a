BACKEND:
1. Add tipping option into Order (this is probably a frontend thing though, could be added as a tip in orderArray)
5. Make a way to remove an order from a tab (order.destroy w/ destroy associations (the order_items))

FRONTEND:
2. Make a tabs page to show active and old tabs (Might be better to make tabs AND finished orders on the same page, not separate pages)
3. Fix CSS styling of components
4. Maybe show the time current tabs were opened and the time closed tabs were last updated??
5. Make tabs that were closed disappear after 24 hours?
8. Make modal open/close for each card w/ fulfill options (separate component; show the full tab name there)
9. Recently fulfilled/recall button
11. Make the Order have a name whether or not the tab exists (if it does, take the name from the tab) (should be really easy, only frontend stuff)
12. Make the Order have a "Dine-in" or "Take-out" option, also frontend only
13. Experiment with the cardheader font; make sure it's monospaced
